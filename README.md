 ## This is me
  
During the day im focused. Creating, investigating, planning, reading, studying.
In bed I need a notebook, because one idea pops up after another idea.
At night i dream solutions.
And in the morning I run. Some days hard, some days relaxt. Some days far, some days just a bit. After that, bring it on. 
<br><br>
 
As a kid I was a runner, later I became a walker. Relaxt chatting while walking a halve a marathon. 
At the start of corona my daughter couldn't go to her sport club anymore and asked me to run with her. I havent stopped since.
Two times a week I run 6km with my friend, chatting away. Like tea time, but more active.
Two times a week I run with my mom at our atletics club, learning running techniques. Mostly 7km, while I'm chatting to my mom. 
And I run with my husband. My husband only knows one speed, and that's full speed. His biggest passion is speed surfing. It's all about fast, faster, fastest. 
He doesn't run underneath 10km and doesn't do 'fast walking'. So, no chatting, just full speed. Well, it makes me push myself, and I like it (afterwards). 
<br><br>
 
Every full moon I go for a walk with my (spiritual) friend. We just enjoy the nature and chat about life.
We also do all sorts of activities outside of our comfort zone. 
Like ecstatic dance. Don't connect with your surrounding, only connect with yourself.
We went singing, because we feared it.
Sweat lodge, painting class, mud survival, walk bare feet in the snow, etc etc.
Silence day at a community. 8 hours of yoga, meditation, walk in nature, eating without talking or eye contact. Only to learn to listen to ourselfs.
If we fear something, we'll do it.
<br><br>
 
I was born near the sea, where I go swimmimg in the summer.
After I found out I feared cold circumstances, I started swimming on cold days. The coldest water temperature I swom in was 7 degrees celcious. Brrr.
<br><br>
 
At my former house I had a vegatable garden, I find it a beautiful process of seeing the plants grow. At my new house I decided to not have one again. Now I have lots of pots with herbs, fruits and flowers in the garden. Inside the house I have a lot different types of plants. I think I have about 20 aloÃ« Vera plants, my daughters like to make lotion of it. <br>
When I had to create an e-commerce website for my study I decided to have create a plant shop.
<br><br>
 
I always have lots of ideas and always write everything down.
I have an diary app to write every day a little bit about my life.
Old fashion papers I use for my brainstorming. Every time an idea pops up, I write it down and working it out to a plan.
I use trello to plan my studying and projects.
When I had to create an database project, I decide to create a bucketlist website.
