My friends call my livingroom 'the jungle', because I have lots of plants. <br> 
So when I had to create a e-commerce website for my study I decided to do a plant shop, so everybody can create his own Home Jungle.

## This is me
  
### üéá
During the day I'm focused, creating, investigating, planning, reading, studying. <br>
When it's dark I need a notebook, because one idea pops up after another idea. <br>
At night I dream solutions. <br>
And in the morning I run. Some days hard, some days relaxt. Some days far, some days just a bit.

### üèÉ
I run with my friend, chatting away. Like tea time, but more active. <br>
I run with my mom at our atletics club, learning running techniques. <br>
And I run with my husband. My husband only knows one speed, and that's full speed. His biggest passion is speed surfing. It's all about fast, faster, fastest. 
He doesn't run underneath 10km and doesn't do 'fast walking'. So, no chatting, just full speed. <br>
Well, it makes me push myself, and I like it (afterwards). 
 
### üåï
Every full moon I go for a walk with my friend. We just enjoy the nature and chat about life.  <br>
We also do all sorts of activities outside of our comfort zone.  <br>
Like ecstatic dance. Don't connect with your surrounding, only connect with yourself. <br>
Silence day at a community. 8 hours of yoga, meditation, walk in nature, eating without talking or eye contact. Only to learn to listen to ourselfs. <br>
I found out I'm affraid of cold circumstances, when I had to walk bare foot in the snow. Since then I do it every winter. <br>
Also I started swimming outdoors on cold days. The coldest water temperature I swom in was 7 degrees celcius. Brrr. <br>
